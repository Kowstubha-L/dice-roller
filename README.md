# dice-roller
A dice roller using JavaScript is a simple web application that simulates the rolling of dice. It typically features an HTML interface with a button labeled "Roll Dice." When the button is clicked, JavaScript generates random numbers to represent the outcome of rolling one or more dice. The results are then displayed on the screen, often with visual representations of dice faces. The application can support different types of dice, like 6-sided and can allow for rolling multiple dice at once. It provides a fun and interactive way to simulate dice rolls for games or decision-making, using basic JavaScript functions like Math.random() and DOM manipulation techniques.
